# Transform Your OpenAPI Spec into Interactive, AI-Powered Documentation with [GitBook](https://gitbook.com)


Welcome! Today we're going to set up a docs site with GitBook that
contains both product docs and auto-updating API docs. 

You'll learn how to quickly get up-and-running with a GitBook docs
site, customize that site, add an OpenAPI spec, build and customize
docs from that spec, and use the GitBook AI Assistant to ask 
questions about your docs and API. 

Here are the steps:
1. Fork this repo
2. Sign up for [GitBook](https://app.gitbook.com/join)
3. Create your GitBook org and site
4. Set up Git Sync with your newly forked repo (under **Monorepo**, specify the `./docs-before` directory.)
5. Open a change request and make a simple modification
5. Publish and view the docs
6. Customize the docs - change the styling, the fonts, the icons - then republish
7. Add your OpenAPI spec - use the ["before" spec](https://github.com/GitbookIO/api_days_paris_2025/blob/main/api-specs/evolve-basic-before.yaml)
8. Add an OpenAPI block to your page
9. Add a set of OpenAPI pages to your docs and re-publish your docs.
10. Customize your OpenAPI spec, push changes, refresh the spec, and see the changes.
11. Ask some questions about the spec to the GitBook Assistant.
